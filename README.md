# Gatherly (reset)

This repository has been archived and reset for a full re-implementation.

## What Gatherly is
Gatherly is a collaborative event planning platform for casual group gatherings (potlucks, camping, hiking, game nights). The core differentiator is a shared **logistics toolkit** (items/tasks with ownership, status, quantity/tags/notes), plus proposals & voting for time/location and a commute visualizer.

## Source of truth
- Product/roadmap docs live in `docs/`.
- Project planning and task breakdown live in Linear (Project: **Gatherly**).

## Notes
- Previous codebase has been moved to an archive folder under `~/Projects/personal/`.
- This repo intentionally contains **no implementation**.
