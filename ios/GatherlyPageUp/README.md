# Gatherly iOS “Page Up” skeleton

Goal: a minimal native iOS app that displays the deployed Gatherly web UI.

- URL: `https://gatherly.qingbo.us`
- This is intentionally thin (WKWebView wrapper) for early device testing.

Next step: create Xcode project (SwiftUI + WKWebView) and keep it in `ios/GatherlyPageUp/`.
