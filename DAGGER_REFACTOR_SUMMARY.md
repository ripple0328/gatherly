# Dagger-for-GitHub Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the refactoring changes made to migrate from direct Dagger CLI usage to the `dagger/dagger-for-github` GitHub Action.

## Overview

The project has been successfully refactored to use the `dagger/dagger-for-github` action instead of manually installing and running the Dagger CLI in GitHub Actions. This provides better integration, automatic caching, and simplified workflow configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. GitHub Workflow Refactoring (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Install Dagger CLI
  run: |
    curl -L https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | sudo sh
    sudo mv /bin/dagger /usr/local/bin/
    dagger version

- name: Run Dependencies Check
  run: dagger call deps --source=. sync
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Run Dependencies Check
  uses: dagger/dagger-for-github@v8.0.0
  with:
    version: "latest"
    verb: call
    args: deps --source=. sync
```

### 2. Documentation Updates

#### Updated `README.md`
- Added GitHub Actions section explaining the new workflow
- Reorganized development workflow documentation
- Updated instructions for local vs CI usage

#### Updated `CLAUDE.md`
- Replaced direct CLI instructions with GitHub Actions integration details
- Added explanation of when to use each approach (Mix tasks vs GitHub Actions vs CLI)
- Updated workflow guidance for development teams

#### Updated `.dagger/README.md`
- Complete rewrite with comprehensive documentation
- Added architecture overview and module function documentation
- Explained all three usage patterns: GitHub Actions, Mix tasks, and direct CLI
- Added configuration and development guidelines

## Benefits of the Refactoring

### 1. **Simplified CI Configuration**
- No manual Dagger CLI installation required
- Automatic version management and caching
- Consistent execution environment

### 2. **Better GitHub Integration**
- Native GitHub Actions artifact handling
- Improved caching and performance
- Seamless integration with GitHub's security model

### 3. **Enhanced Developer Experience**
- Clearer separation between local development and CI
- Consistent behavior across different environments
- Better error handling and debugging

### 4. **Improved Maintainability**
- Centralized version management
- Reduced workflow complexity
- Better documentation and onboarding

## Architecture After Refactoring

```
Development Workflows:
├── Local Development
│   ├── mix dagger.* tasks (primary)
│   └── Direct dagger CLI (optional)
└── CI/CD Pipeline
    ├── GitHub Actions with dagger/dagger-for-github
    └── Automated artifact export and caching
```

## Workflow Behavior

### GitHub Actions Pipeline
1. **Dependencies Check**: Install and cache Elixir dependencies
2. **Quality Checks**: Run formatting, Credo, and Dialyzer
3. **Security Checks**: Run vulnerability scanning
4. **Tests**: Execute test suite with PostgreSQL database
5. **Build**: Create production release with assets
6. **Export**: Generate build artifacts for deployment

### Local Development
- **Mix Tasks**: Primary development workflow with `mix dagger.*`
- **Direct CLI**: Available for advanced use cases
- **Container Integration**: Full CI pipeline can be run locally

## Files Modified

1. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Complete refactoring to use GitHub Action
2. **`README.md`** - Updated development and CI documentation
3. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Updated project guidance and workflow instructions
4. **`.dagger/README.md`** - Complete rewrite with comprehensive documentation

## Files Unchanged (Intentionally)

1. **`lib/mix/tasks/dagger/*.ex`** - Mix tasks remain for local development
2. **`.dagger/lib/gatherly_ci.ex`** - Dagger module unchanged (works with both approaches)
3. **`dagger.json`** - Configuration remains compatible
4. **Local development tools** - No impact on daily development workflow

## Verification Steps

To verify the refactoring works correctly:

1. **Local Testing** (unchanged):
   ```bash
   mix dagger.ci --fast
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions Testing**:
   - Create a pull request to trigger the workflow
   - Verify all steps complete successfully
   - Check that artifacts are properly exported

3. **Documentation Verification**:
   - Review updated documentation for accuracy
   - Ensure all examples work as described

## Migration Benefits

- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Local development workflow unchanged
- **Improved CI Performance**: Better caching and parallelization
- **Enhanced Security**: No manual CLI installation scripts
- **Future-Proof**: Automatic updates and maintenance

## Next Steps

1. Test the refactored workflow with a pull request
2. Monitor CI performance and caching effectiveness
3. Update team documentation and training materials
4. Consider adding Dagger Cloud integration for further optimization

**Note**: This refactoring maintains backward compatibility while modernizing the CI/CD pipeline. Local development workflows remain unchanged, ensuring a smooth transition for the development team.
