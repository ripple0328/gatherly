# Staging Deployment Removal Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to remove staging deployment from the Gatherly CI/CD pipeline, simplifying the workflow to focus solely on production deployment.

## Overview

The project has been refactored to remove the staging deployment environment and simplify the CI/CD pipeline to a direct-to-production workflow. This change reduces complexity while maintaining quality through comprehensive CI checks and local development workflows.

## Changes Made

### 1. GitHub Workflows Updated

#### CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
**Before:**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
```

**After:**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
```

#### Deployment Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
**Removed:**
- `deploy-staging` job
- Staging environment configuration
- `develop` branch trigger
- Environment selection in workflow dispatch

**Simplified:**
- Single production deployment job
- Simplified workflow dispatch (no environment selection)
- Streamlined rollback (production only)

### 2. Configuration Files

#### Removed Files
- `fly.staging.toml` - Staging Fly.io configuration

#### Updated Files
- `fly.toml` - Production configuration remains unchanged
- `dagger.json` - No changes needed (deployment agnostic)

### 3. Documentation Updates

#### Updated `README.md`
- Removed staging URL and references
- Simplified deployment flow diagram
- Updated deployment workflow instructions
- Removed staging-specific monitoring instructions

#### Updated `docs/CI_CD_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Removed staging deployment section
- Simplified pipeline architecture diagram
- Updated deployment process documentation
- Removed staging health checks and monitoring

#### Updated `CLAUDE.md`
- Updated CI/CD workflow description
- Removed staging deployment references
- Simplified configuration files list

## New Simplified Architecture

```
Development → CI Pipeline → Production
     ↓             ↓            ↓
• Local Tests → Quality Gate → Fly.io
• Mix Tasks   → Security     → Health Checks
• Dagger CLI  → Full Tests   → Rollback Ready
```

## Deployment Flow After Changes

### Previous Flow
```
feature → develop → staging → main → production
```

### New Simplified Flow
```
feature → main → production
```

## Benefits of Staging Removal

### 1. **Simplified Workflow**
- Single branch for production deployments (`main`)
- No environment confusion or complexity
- Clearer deployment responsibilities

### 2. **Reduced Maintenance**
- No staging infrastructure to maintain
- Single Fly.io app configuration
- Fewer secrets and environment variables

### 3. **Faster Deployment**
- Direct path from development to production
- No intermediate staging step required
- Reduced overall deployment time

### 4. **Cost Optimization**
- No staging environment hosting costs
- Single production environment to monitor
- Simplified resource allocation

## Quality Assurance Strategy

With staging removed, quality assurance relies on:

### 1. **Comprehensive Local Development**
```bash
# Complete CI pipeline locally
mix dagger.ci

# Fast feedback loop
mix dagger.ci --fast

# Individual checks
mix dagger.test
mix dagger.quality
mix dagger.security
```

### 2. **Robust CI Pipeline**
- Full containerized testing with PostgreSQL
- Code quality checks (formatting, Credo, Dialyzer)
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Production build verification

### 3. **Production Safeguards**
- Quality gate before production deployment
- Comprehensive health checks post-deployment
- Automatic rollback capability
- Manual deployment controls

## Migration Impact

### Zero Breaking Changes
- Local development workflow unchanged
- Mix tasks continue to work as before
- Dagger module remains fully functional
- Production deployment process improved

### Developer Experience
- Simpler mental model (single production target)
- Faster feedback from main branch pushes
- Clearer deployment status and monitoring

## Updated Workflows

### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Develop and test locally with `mix dagger.ci --fast`
3. Push feature branch (triggers CI checks)
4. Create PR to `main` (triggers full CI validation)
5. Merge to `main` (triggers production deployment)

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Rollback**: Use GitHub Actions workflow dispatch
2. **Manual Deploy**: Use workflow dispatch with skip CI option
3. **Health Monitoring**: Direct production URL monitoring

## Monitoring and Health Checks

### Production URLs
- **Primary**: https://gatherly.qingbo.us
- **Fly.io**: https://gatherly.fly.dev

### Health Check Commands
```bash
# Application health
curl -f https://gatherly.qingbo.us/
curl -f https://gatherly.fly.dev/

# Fly.io status
flyctl status --app gatherly
flyctl logs --app gatherly
```

## File Changes Summary

### Modified Files
1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Simplified branch triggers
2. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Removed staging deployment
3. `README.md` - Updated documentation
4. `docs/CI_CD_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive doc update
5. `CLAUDE.md` - Updated project guidance

### Removed Files
1. `fly.staging.toml` - Staging configuration no longer needed

### Unchanged Files
- `.dagger/lib/gatherly_ci.ex` - Dagger module works for any deployment
- `lib/mix/tasks/dagger/*.ex` - Local development tasks unchanged
- `fly.toml` - Production configuration remains the same
- All Phoenix application code - No application changes needed

## Verification Steps

To verify the changes work correctly:

1. **Local Testing**:
   ```bash
   mix dagger.ci
   ```

2. **CI Pipeline**:
   - Create PR to `main` branch
   - Verify CI runs successfully
   - Check that only production deployment is available

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Merge to `main` branch
   - Verify automatic production deployment
   - Check health checks pass

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- Feature flags for safer production deployments
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Canary releases for gradual rollouts
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting

### If Staging is Needed Again
The staging deployment can be re-added by:
1. Restoring `fly.staging.toml`
2. Adding staging job back to deploy workflow
3. Adding `develop` branch triggers
4. Updating documentation accordingly

---

**Conclusion**: The removal of staging deployment simplifies the CI/CD pipeline while maintaining quality through comprehensive local testing and robust CI checks. This change aligns with modern deployment practices that favor simplicity and direct production deployment with strong safeguards.
