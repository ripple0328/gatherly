## Overview

Modern group event planning is fragmented across many tools: calendar apps, messaging platforms, spreadsheets, and ad hoc polls. Users often struggle with coordination, logistics tracking, and role assignment — especially for casual events like potlucks, camping trips, or game nights.

Gatherly enters this space with a unified, AI-enhanced experience built around collaborative planning.
