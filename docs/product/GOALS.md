# Gatherly — Product goals

## One-liner
A collaborative event planning platform for casual group gatherings (potlucks, camping, hiking, game nights) where **everyone** can contribute to scheduling, voting, and logistics.

## Vision
Make group planning feel shared, structured, and lightweight—less chaos than group chats, less rigidity than project tools.

## Differentiators
1) **Logistics toolkit (core):** shared items/tasks with ownership + statuses + quantities + tags/notes.
2) **Proposals + voting:** anyone can propose time/location; group votes; host can optionally lock.
3) **Commute visualizer:** show travel impact during location proposal (not only after selection).
4) **Low-friction access:** OAuth + magic links; optional anonymous participation.
5) **AI assistance (layered):** coverage checks, suggestions, summaries (after core flows are stable).

## Core modules (conceptual)
- Events (create/join/RSVP)
- Proposals + voting (time/location)
- Logistics board (items/tasks)
- Discussion forum (threaded)
- Commute visualization
- Summaries/exports

## Roadmap (high level)
- Phase 0: Foundations — specs + key decisions
- Phase 1: MVP — Potluck planning end-to-end
- Phase 2: Multi-event templates — camping/hiking/game night
- Phase 3: AI assistance — suggestions, coverage analysis, summaries
- Phase 4: Real-time UX — notifications, PWA polish, live updates
